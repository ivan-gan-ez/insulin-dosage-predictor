Greetings!

Data acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robyburns/insulin-dosage.

The "Predictor" page is where all the main prediction stuff happens. Simply enter the information required and hit "Analyse Risk".
It should be returning something along the lines of "steady", "up", "down" or "no", formatted into an actual sentence. If you get an error or a response outside of those four, congrats, you probably found a bug or something that I missed. Well done.

The "Data" page contains several averages of numerical columns, a comparison of various variables with each other, the distribution of every variable in the dataset and also a randomised sample of 50 rows from said dataset.
